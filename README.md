# The Guardian Tab Component

## Dependencies

npm install --save-dev qunit

## How to run me? 

Simply open the index.html in a browser. 
The API request should be done automatically and populate the table. 
You then only need to click on tabs to display different articles. 
Each entries are clickable. 

## Considerations

### Browser support
The code should run in most of the browser. 
The only tool that was used that is not supported in IE is fetch(). 

### Reusability

The html elements were could be reused for other situations, only by changing the ids. 
The javascript code is a bit more specific but lots of variables are global and easy to change. 

### Accessibility 

I attempted to use correct HTML tags.

### Test coverage

In the last minutes of the programming test, I tried to install QUnit and start to write tests but I lacked time.
